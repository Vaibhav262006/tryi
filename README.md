git commit - it is record of change 
git commit -m "feature you changed or fixed bug"
after doing commit you type git status it will display----
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

this simply means that on local machine we are one commit ahead as compared to our github repo
